# DIY 30KM/H ELECTRIC SKATEBOARD – RASPBERRY PI POWERED

Over the summer, I made my own electric skateboard using a £4 Raspberry Pi Zero. Controlled with a Nintendo Wiimote, capable of going 30km/h, and with a range of over 10km, this project has been pretty darn fun. In the video, you see me racing around Cambridge and I explain the ins and outs of this project. You can watch the video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WLEur3M8Yk

This project has (to my surprise!) been featured all around the net: including Popular Mechanics, Hackaday and the BBC. This Github repo contains *all* of the code that I use to make my DIY electric skateboard purr.
